## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `SQL`: the folder to maintain SQL queries
- `bills`: the folder to maintain all generated bills

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Git commands

create branch : git branch branchname
switch branch : git checkout branchname
push changes : 1. git add .
                2. git commit -m "changes message"
                3. git push origin branchname
                4. git pull
                5. git merge
                6. git branch
                7. git checkout
